# Configuration of Stata

This folder contains configuration files for Stata.
It assumes that the host OS where Stata is installed is a Unix-like (e.g., Linux, macOS) system.

The file `profile.do` is moved to Stata's installation directory, which is assumed to be `/usr/local/Stata16`.
This file will be executed everytime Stata is started.

The file `install_packages.do` is supposed to be run only once, and it installs the packages that I use most frequently.

# Linux

The files in this folder assume to be on either a [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/) base or a [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) base.
Most installed packages are DE-agnostic, but some of them assume that Gnome is installed and used.

They have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04 and Fedora 36-37-38, but they may work on other releases as well.

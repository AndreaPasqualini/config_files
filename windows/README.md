# Windows Setup

With [winget](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-package-manager-1-1/), Microsoft made it (much) easier to install applications programmatically.

Applications that I'm not installing with winget:
| What             | Why                                               |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| WSL              | I'd rather manually decide on a per-machine basis |
| Microsoft Office | Manually using an Office 365 Enterprise installer |
| MATLAB           | Not in winget repos, proprietary                  |
| Stata            | Not in winget repos, proprietary                  |
| Julia            | Older version in repository                       |

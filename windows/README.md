# Windows Setup

With [winget](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-package-manager-1-1/), Microsoft made it (much) easier to install applications programmatically.


## Limitations

Applications that cannot be installed with winget:
- Microsoft Office
- MATLAB
- Stata
- Julia (older version in repository)

WSL can be installed with winget, but I choose not to here, because I'd rather manually decide on a per-machine basis.

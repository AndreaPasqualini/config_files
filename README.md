# Configuration Files

These files allow me to speed up the setup of my machines in case I blow them up, somebody/something else blows them up or I get my hands on a new one.
The goal is to automatize the installation of apps and configuration of the system as much as possible.
Ideally, I'd let the machine run these and I'd be up and running in 20 minutes (depending on the speed of the internet connection).

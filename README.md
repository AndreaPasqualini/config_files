# Configuration Files

These files allow me to speed up the setup of my machines in case I blow them up, somebody/something else blows them up or I get my hands on a new one.
The goal is to automatize the installation of apps and configuration of the system as much as possible.
Ideally, I'd let the machine run these and I'd be up and running in 20 minutes (depending on the speed of the internet connection).


## Notes on executing scripts

A responsibility waiver is in the [License file](./LICENSE).
You run the scripts at your own risk.
If you run my code and your machine explodes and you point the finger at me, I will laugh at you.
Read the code before executing, unless you blindly trust the source (you shouldn't anyway).
What I publish here should work (works for me, at least), but you have the reponsibility of _understanding_ before executing.

Pull Requests are welcome!

Thanks to [@eddelbuettel](https://github.com/eddelbuettel) for [his script](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/mkl4deb/blob/master/script.sh) to install Intel's MKL on deb-based systems.
My version differs from his just for the update to the specific MKL version I want to download.
